MAVEN : 
=========================
> It is a powerful tool which helps in building, managing and documenting your project

> Maven by heart is a plugin based tool

> whenever a maven plugin or command is executed, its output will be stored in folder called target

> It has 2 types of plugins:

Core Build plugins:
=============================================================================================================
Task  					Plugin					GOAL/Commands 	     output
==============================================================================================================
Compile the code  			Compiler				mvn compile		class files

execute some Testcases		       Surefire				        mvn test		test passed/failed status

Package the code			package					mvn package            .war file

Clean the previous build	        clean					 mvn clean		clean up from target folder
filesfrom target folder

Deploy artifact on 			deploy					mvn deploy
artifactory

install all dependencies	        install					mvn install


In maven multiple goals can be executed together

# mvn clean install package



Reporting plugins:
==============================
Will always generate reports, and in maven the reports are mostly generated in the format : xml,html,txt

Task  						Plugin			GOAL/Commands 	                        output

Code Review				pmd				mvn pmd:pmd		               pmd.xml report	

test reports				surefire			mvn test		              surefire reports - xml,txt

Code coverage				JACOCO,sonarqube		mvn sonar:sonar



Structure MAVEN project

src/main/java   ==> source code will be present
src/test/java   ==> test cases will be present

pom.xml   ==> heart of maven project

 1. dependencies   ==> tools downloded by developer to write code

 2. plugin information
We will create a build tag which will hold the plugin names and version using which you can 
> build
> test
> compile

 3. Repositories ( local, central & remote)
URLs or location from where we have to download  the plugin or dependency softwares
